                <li>1 large can (28 ounces) whole San Marzano tomatoes</li>
                <li>12 ounces (dry weight) ovoline-type mozzarella or other fresh mozzarella balls, ideally water-packed</li>
                <li>Handful of fresh basil, thinly sliced plus small leaves</li>

        <h3 class="steps">Steps</h3>
        <div class="steps-container">
            <ol class="steps-list-centered">
                <li><pre>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees Fahrenheit with a rack in the upper third of the oven. 
If you're using a baking stone or baking steel, place it on the upper rack. 
Prepare dough through step 5.</pre></li>
                <li><pre>Place a medium mixing bowl in the sink and pour the canned tomatoes into the bowl, juices and all. 
Crush the tomatoes by hand. 
Spread about ¾ cup of the tomato sauce evenly over each pizza, leaving about 1 inch bare around the edges.</pre></li>
                <li><pre>If your mozzarella is packed in water, drain off the water and gently pat the mozzarella dry on a clean tea towel or paper towels. 
If you're working with large mozzarella balls, tear them into smaller 1-inch balls. 
Distribute the mozzarella over the pizza, concentrating it a bit more in the center of the pizza, as it will melt toward the edges.</pre></li>
                <li><pre>Bake pizzas individually on the top rack until the crust is golden and the cheese is just turning golden, 
about 10 to 12 minutes (or significantly less, if you're using a baking stone/steel—keep an eye on it).</pre></li>
                <li><pre>Top each pizza generously with fresh basil, followed by a light back-and-forth drizzle of olive oil, 
a sprinkling of salt, and red pepper flakes, if you wish. Slice and enjoy. 
Leftover pizza will keep well in the refrigerator for up to 4 days.</pre></li>
